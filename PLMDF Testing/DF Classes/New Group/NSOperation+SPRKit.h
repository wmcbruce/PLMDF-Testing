/**
 \brief
 The NSOperation+SPRKit category adds methods to NSOperation that simplify
 access to the \c error and \c result properties of the receiver's \c
 dependencies .
 
 \discussion
 This category exists to encourage use of fine-grain operations that cascade
 their outputs to their downstream dependencies. This has several benefits
 including improving testability, ease of maintenance, and encouraging
 definition of proper dependencies between operations which allows an
 NSOperationQueue to maximize concurrency.
 
 In the past, this has been onerous to create fine-grain operations due to the
 lack of a standard mechanism to hand-off the output of each step to the next.
 This category defines \c -error and \c -result as the mechanism for handing
 off outputs and provides methods to make it easier to access those outputs.
 
 For example, instead of creating a monolithic NSOperation subclass that
 downloads, parses, and saves data, it may be preferrable to create three
 NSOperation subclasses: one that downloads the data, another that picks up
 that data and parses it, and a final operation that takes the parsed data and
 saves it.
